			<h2>The History of The Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
			<p>The Golden Gate Bridge was officially opened on May 27, 1937, the longest  span in the world. The first public crossroads took place the day before, with 200,000 people walking, running and  roller skating on new bridges. The idea dates back to 1869, but the proposal took hold in 1916. James Wilkins, a former engineering student who worked as a journalist in the San Francisco Bulletin, demanded a suspension bridge with a 3,000-foot central span, almost twice as long as the existing bridge. Wilkins' idea was valued at an astonishing $ 100 million. So Michael M. O'Shaughnessy, a city engineer in San Francisco, began asking bridge engineers if they could do it for less.</p>
